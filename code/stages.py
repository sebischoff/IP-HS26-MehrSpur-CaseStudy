=========
Infrastructure stage specifications for the SBB MehrSpur Zürich–Winterthur project.

A 'stage' captures the physical infrastructure and operational interventions
that modify the multimodal transport network and skims in the Canton Zürich FSM model.

HOW TO USE
----------
Edit the two named packages below to define physical interventions and their
spatial scope. Each package groups railway improvements, mobility hubs and
appraisal assumptions (CAPEX, construction emissions and asset lifetime).
Baseline headway, technology and capacity assumptions stay in parameters.py;
deployment timing and triggers stay in adaptive_planning.py.
ASCs/betas describe common behavior, not automatic benefits of individual hubs.
Asset lifetimes below affect final-year appraisal only, not transport.

SURROGATE CONSEQUENCE
---------------------
The two packages can operate independently. Transport states are 0 (baseline),
1 (stations), 2 (tunnel), and 3 (both). The combined state contains the two
packages' benefits once each plus COMBINED_EFFECTS. One GP learns all four configurations. Changes
to their physical effects require rebuilding the surrogate and response table.
Changing only plan timing, costs, comfort capacity, construction emissions or
asset lifetimes does not require a surrogate rebuild. Rerun appraisal to include them.

--- CHEAT SHEET: PARAMETERS & INTERVENTIONS ---

1. Defining Spatial Scopes
   Interventions are targeted geographically using spatial filters:
   
   - "area_pairs": Selects OD skim cells between origins and destinations, not physical links.
     Filter by "municipality_name" (e.g. "Dietikon") or "city_quartier" (e.g. "Altstetten").
     Example: Reducing rail travel time between Zürich and Winterthur:
       "railway_expansions": [
           {
               "name": "Corridor Rail Upgrade",
               "area_pairs": [
                   {"origin": {"municipality_name": "Zürich"}, "destination": {"municipality_name": "Winterthur"}}
               ],
               "both_directions": True,
               "effects": {
                   "travel_time_reduction_pct": 15.0
               }
           }
       ]
   
   - "zones": Used for area-wide or zone-based interventions (e.g., station access, local networks).
     Filter by specific zone IDs or whole municipality names. The model selects
     the first two candidate stops per zone for walk and bicycle access, then
     applies effects to journeys using those stops.
     Example: Improving PT access & egress times in Dietlikon:
       "mobility_hubs": [
           {
               "name": "Dietlikon Hub Area",
               "zones": [{"municipality_name": "Dietlikon"}],  # or zone IDs: ["15401012"]
               "effects": {
                   "access_time_reduction_pct": 20.0,
                   "egress_time_reduction_pct": 20.0
               }
           }
       ]


       
2. Mode-Specific Physical Interventions
   Effects are defined under specific mode keys which target different transport networks:
   - "railway_expansions": A list of railway interventions. The section/service
     entry sets minutes saved, headway reduction and added comfort capacity.
     Additional entries can use OD filters and percentage "effects" as above.
   - "bike_highways": Modifies the Bicycle network.
   - "road_capacity": Modifies selected directed links in the local MSA road network.
   - "mobility_hubs": Modifies PT access, egress and transfer times for walk and bicycle access.
   - "section_time_saving_min" in a "railway_expansions" entry, or directly in a
     package: Minutes saved on the selected parameters.SECTION. For bike_route,
     enter the saving for the complete route; each journey receives the fraction
     corresponding to the improved route length it uses. A pt_stop instead uses
     station-specific mobility_hubs effects below.
     Savings are relative to baseline: stations save 1 minute, the tunnel 4,
     and both packages 6, including a 1-minute combined bonus. The optional external cohort receives the same saving
     in appraisal, without entering mode choice or assignment.
     Section settings follow parameters.SECTION; headway settings apply between
     corridor municipalities. OD filters on additional entries scope only their
     percentage "effects". Comfort capacity is used in crowding appraisal.

   Within these keys, you can apply effects like:
   - "travel_time_reduction_pct" (Reduces in-vehicle travel time)
   - "speed_increase_pct" (Increases average speed)
   - "distance_reduction_pct" (Reduces trip distance, e.g., a new tunnel or bridge)
   - "access_time_reduction_pct", "egress_time_reduction_pct" (Reduces walk time to/from PT)
   
   EXAMPLE 1: Road intervention (increasing selected link capacity by 25%)
   "road_capacity": [
       {
           # Find these directional IDs with the link editor in Notebook 02.
           "edge_ids": ["OSM_123456_789012_0", "OSM_789012_123456_0"],
           "effects": {"capacity_increase_pct": 25.0}
       }
   ]

   Road capacity is link-based: ``area_pairs`` select OD skim cells and cannot
   identify physical road links. The transport interface applies these edits
   to a copy of the corridor immediately before MSA assignment.

   EXAMPLE 2: Station Access Intervention (Reducing PT access/egress times by 20%)
   "mobility_hubs": [
       {
           "zones": [{"municipality_name": "Dietlikon"}],
           "effects": {"access_time_reduction_pct": 20.0, "egress_time_reduction_pct": 20.0}
       }
   ]

   EXAMPLE 3: Bike Intervention (Shortening bike travel distance by 15% via a direct cycle path/bridge)
   "bike_highways": [
       {
           "area_pairs": [{"origin": {"city_quartier": "Altstetten"}, "destination": {"municipality_name": "Dietikon"}}],
           "both_directions": True,
           "effects": {
               "distance_reduction_pct": 15.0,
               "speed_increase_pct": 10.0
           }
       }
   ]

   For a counted cycling route configured in parameters.SECTION, a package can
   instead set "section_time_saving_min": 2.0 directly. Do not also apply an OD
   time reduction for the same improvement.

   EXAMPLE 4: A specific station (rather than a municipality-wide access package)
   "mobility_hubs": [
       {"station": "Wallisellen", "effects": {
           "access_time_reduction_pct": 25.0,
           "egress_time_reduction_pct": 20.0,
           "transfer_time_reduction_pct": 15.0
       }}
   ]
   Access and egress affect their respective station users. Transfer reductions
   affect only represented physical walking at this station, not through users.
